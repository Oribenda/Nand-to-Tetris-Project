# Nand-to-Tetris-Project

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the "Nand to Tetris: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" course. 
Through this course, I've built a complete computer system from the ground up, starting with basic logic gates and progressing all the way to high-level programming.
